Subject: CORS Fixed - Backend Ready for Testing! 🎉

Hey Gift!

Great work on the integration! CORS is now configured and deployed. ✅

**What I added:**
- ✅ http://localhost:8081 (your dev server)
- ✅ http://localhost:4173 (your production preview)
- ✅ Additional common dev ports for flexibility

**Backend Status:**
- Live URL: https://homs-backend-txs8.onrender.com
- Render is auto-deploying the CORS changes (takes ~2 minutes)
- All endpoints ready: POST /summary, GET /summary/today, etc.

**You can test now:**
1. Wait ~2 minutes for Render deployment to complete
2. Restart your dev server (just to be safe)
3. Try POSTing a daily summary from your desktop app
4. Check https://homs-backend-txs8.onrender.com/docs to verify the data arrived

**Testing the flow:**
```javascript
// Your POST should work now
fetch('https://homs-backend-txs8.onrender.com/summary', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    date: "2026-02-01",
    rooms_total: 20,
    rooms_occupied: 8,
    rooms_available: 12,
    cash_collected: 350000,
    momo_collected: 120000,
    total_collected: 470000,
    expected_balance: 470000,
    expenses_logged: 20000
  })
})
```

Once you successfully POST data, I'll refresh my mobile app and should see it instantly! 📱

Let me know as soon as it works!
